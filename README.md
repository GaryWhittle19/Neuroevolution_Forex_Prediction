### In order to run:
1. Install Anaconda for Windows with Python 3.7 (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Open Anaconda Prompt
#### Steps 3-8 (written):
3. Create an Anaconda environment                                                     'conda create --name pyesn_environment'
4. Activate the Anaconda environment                                                  'conda activate pyesn_environment'
5. Install pip in the environment                                                     'conda install pip'
6. Install pandas, numpy, plotly, and cufflinks in the environment using pip          'pip install numpy pandas plotly cufflinks'
7. Change directory to the one containing source files                                'cd [path to source code]'
8. Execute main.py to run program. See below for controlling program parameters       'python main.py'

### Step 9 (optional - if saving .txt is required). 
To save the output to a .txt file, simply add '> output.txt' to the end of the program execution command. The output will be stored in the source directory. Execute program like so: 'python main.py > output.txt'

This redirects the output to the text file, so none will be visible in Anaconda prompt; one solution to this is running the program using PyCharm, with the correct configuration. The brief video below shows how to do this.

### How to use:
Once the above steps are complete, user interaction can take place within the 'parameters.py' file in the source directory. Here, users have access to a variety of important training and testing settings. Outlined below is each of these and their relevance to the application.
